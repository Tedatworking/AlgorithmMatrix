Find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of any subset of a given array
Given a sorted array (sorted in non-decreasing order) of positive numbers, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of elements of any subset of given set. 
Expected time complexity is O(n).
